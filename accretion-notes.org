* Equation of state
- Teuns et al have adiabatic models that get to 1e5 K post shock, for which they estimate cooling times of 10 s, as compared with dynamic time of order a year!
  - density of order 1e9 pcc
- So this fully justifies the isothermal case

* Detached or attached shock?
- This ought to depend on the shock popar
  - There is a maximum angle that the flow can be deviated by an oblique shock, which depends on the gamma
  - Supposedly this is sin theta = 1 / sqrt(gamma) for M \to \infty
    - 50.77 degrees for gamma = 5/3
  - And for \gamma = 1 it is sin theta = 1 / M
  - However I need to check this, since it does not look right
  - 

* Papers on accretion
** Theuns, Boffin & Jorissen 1996
- /cited by Tejeda/
- SPH simulations of accretion in binary systems
- Pretty low resolution, but should be good as far as it goes
- Considers cases of \gamma = 1, 1.1, 1.5 but mainly presents results on 1.5
- Their model has q = 0.33 and w = 0.4
- They find \eta = 0.01 - 0.02 for \gamma = 1.5, and 0.08 for the other models
  - The BHL value is 0.2, although they say 0.1 - 0.2 since they are including the \alpha factor from BH
- They find hydrodynamic thrust and gravitational drag cancel each other out for circular orbits
- They assume \Gamma_edd = 1 in their simulations, so the primary has no effect on the gas!
  - Radiation pressure exactly cancels gravity
  - So there is nothing like the Roche lobe
- They get a flow structure that looks nothing like the BHL picture, at least for \gamma = 5/3
- 
** Theuns 1993
- Earlier discussion of flow structures in same simulations
- The adiabatic simulation is a complete mess
- The isothermal one looks somewhat more ordered, at least in the xz and yz planes
  - But in the xy plane it forms an accretion disk, which means you do not see the accretion column very well
  - This might be an artefact of the low resolution though
- In all the simulations you see large scale spiral shocks that make a spiral arm
  - This is a second source of accreting matter for the secondary
** Antoni et al 2019
- The Evolution of Binaries in a Gaseous Medium: Three-dimensional Simulations of Binary Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton Accretion
- This is a slightly different problem form the one that we are considering
  - It is interaction of a binary with a stream that comes from the outside, not form one of the stars
- But it has some modern simulations and a section on previous numerical simulations that is useful to get me up to date on the literature
- They only simulate the adiabatic case
  - They have a very nice sharp bow shock, with subsonic radial accretion inside it
** Blondin & Raymer 2012
- Adiabatic simulations of classical HL accretion from a uniform stream
- Not much that we can take from it for our case, but is a good example to cite for the bow shock case
- The flow does end up in the wake and hitting the star from the back
- Breathing overstability of the bow shock produces oscillation in the accretion rate of order 10%
** de Val-Borro et al 2018
- Three-dimensional hydrodynamical models of wind and outburst-related accretion in symbiotic systems
- *not cited by Tejeda*
  - but they do cite an earlier 2009 paper
- Again, adiabatic simulations
- Strangely, they get a mass accretion rate that is even larger than the BHL rate
- Simulation parameters, inspired by CH Cyg
  - P = 15.6 yr
  - a = 8.5 au
  - So orbital velocity is 2 pi 8.5 au / 15.6 y = 16 km/s
  - Wind velocity of 20 to 50 km/s
    - So w = 1.3 to 3
  - Stellar masses
    - M_1 = 2 Msun
    - M_2 = 0.56 Msun
    - q = 0.21875
  - So predicted \eta from BHL is q^2 / w (1 + w^2)^1.5
    - q, w = 0.21875, 1.3 => \eta = 8.3e-3
    - q, w = 0.21875, 3 => \eta = 5.0e-4
  - However, their fig 5 indicates that they think that 0.1 is the typical efficiency, /so that is weird/
  - They use an Eddington factor of \Gamma = 0.5
** El Mellah et al 2020
- Wind morphology around cool evolved stars in binaries The case of slowly accelerating oxygen-rich outflows
- They are more interested in the large scale spiral shock
- They characterise their models by f, which they call the "dust condensation radius filling factor", which is the ration of the wind launch radius to the Roche lobe
  - They use values of 0.05 and 0.80
