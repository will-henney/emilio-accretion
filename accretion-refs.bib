  abstract =	 {The Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is
                  widely used to describe how a compact object
                  accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in
                  binary systems. However, its standard implementation
                  becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity
                  (v<SUB>w</SUB>) is comparable to or less than the
                  orbital velocity (v<SUB>o</SUB>), predicting
                  nonphysical accretion efficiencies above unity. This
                  limits its applicability to systems with low
                  wind-to-orbital velocity ratios (w =
                  v<SUB>w</SUB>/v<SUB>o</SUB> ≤ 1), such as symbiotic
                  systems. We revisit the implementation of the BHL
                  model and introduce a geometric correction factor
                  that accounts for the varying orientation of the
                  accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction.
                  This correction ensures physically plausible
                  accretion efficiencies (η ≤ 1) for all w in circular
                  orbits. Our new implementation naturally predicts
                  the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed
                  in numerical simulations for w &lt; 1, without the
                  need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the
                  implications of our prescription for the
                  less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting
                  the key role of the geometric correction factor in
                  shaping the accretion process. We compare our
                  predictions with numerical simulations, finding good
                  agreement for a wide range of parameters.
                  Applications to the symbiotic star R Aqr and the
                  X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved
                  implementation offers a more accurate description of
                  wind accretion in binary systems, with implications
                  for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and
                  observational data interpretation.},

@article{Souami:2020a,
  abstract =	 {We revisit the concept of spheres of gravitational
                  activity, to which we give both a geometrical and a
                  physical meaning. This study aims to refine this
                  concept in a much broader context that could, for
                  instance, be applied to exo-planetary problems (in a
                  Galactic stellar disc-star-planets system) in order
                  to define a first-order 'boundary' of a planetary
                  system. The methods used in this paper rely on
                  classical Celestial Mechanics and develop the
                  equations of motion in the framework of the
                  three-body problem (e.g. Star-Planet-Satellite
                  System). We start with the basic definition of a
                  planet's sphere of activity as the region of space
                  in which it is feasible to assume the planet as the
                  central body and the Sun as the perturbing body when
                  computing perturbations of the satellite's motion.
                  We then investigate the geometrical properties and
                  physical meaning of the ratios of solar
                  accelerations (central and perturbing) and planetary
                  accelerations (central and perturbing), and the
                  boundaries they define. Throughout the paper, we
                  clearly distinguish amongst the sphere of activity,
                  the Chebotarev sphere (a particular case of the
                  sphere of activity), the Laplace sphere, and the
                  Hill sphere. The last two are often wrongfully
                  thought to be one and the same. Furthermore, by
                  taking a closer look at and comparing the ratio of
                  the star's accelerations (central/perturbing) with
                  that of the planetary accelerations
                  (central/perturbing) as a function of the
                  planeto-centric distance, we have identified
                  different dynamical regimes, which are presented in
                  the semi-analytical analysis.},

@article{Ruffert:1996a,
  abstract =	 {We investigate the hydrodynamics of
                  three-dimensional classical Bondi-Hoyle accretion. A
                  totally absorbing sphere of different sizes (1, 0.1
                  and 0.02 accretion radii) moves at different Mach
                  numbers (0.6, 1.4, 3.0 and 10) relative to a
                  homogeneous and slightly perturbed medium, which is
                  taken to be an ideal, nearly isothermal, gas
                  (γ=1.01). We examine the influence of Mach number of
                  the flow and size of the accretor upon the physical
                  behaviour of the flow and the accretion rates. The
                  hydrodynamics is modeled by the ``Piecewise
                  Parabolic Method'' (PPM). The resolution in the
                  vicinity of the accretor is increased by multiply
                  nesting several 32^3^-zone grids around the sphere,
                  each finer grid being a factor of two smaller in
                  zone size than the next coarser grid. This allows us
                  to include a coarse model for the surface of the
                  accretor (vacuum sphere) on the finest grid while at
                  the same time evolving the gas on the coarser grids.
                  For small Mach numbers (0.6 and 1.4) the flow
                  patterns tend towards a steady state, while in the
                  case of supersonic flow (Mach 3 and 10) and small
                  enough accretors (radius of 0.1 and 0.02 accretion
                  radii), an unstable Mach cone develops, destroying
                  axisymmetry. We cannot say whether the flow with
                  small Mach numbers will become unstable for
                  accretors smaller than 0.02 accretion radii. The
                  shock cones in the supersonic models never clear the
                  surface of the accretors (they are tail shocks, not
                  bow shocks) and the opening angle is smaller
                  (compared to models with larger γ) especially for
                  the highly supersonic models. The densities in the
                  shock cone is larger for models with smaller γ. The
                  fluctuations of the accretion rates and flow
                  structures are weaker than in the corresponding
                  models with larger γ. The hydrodynamic drag of all
                  models with accretor sizes of 0.1R_A_ or smaller
                  acts in an accelerating direction, while the
                  gravitational drag is always decelerating and larger
                  than the hydrodynamic drag (thus the net force is
                  decelerating).},
