  abstract =	 {The Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model is
                  widely used to describe how a compact object
                  accretes material from a companion's stellar wind in
                  binary systems. However, its standard implementation
                  becomes inaccurate when the wind velocity
                  (v<SUB>w</SUB>) is comparable to or less than the
                  orbital velocity (v<SUB>o</SUB>), predicting
                  nonphysical accretion efficiencies above unity. This
                  limits its applicability to systems with low
                  wind-to-orbital velocity ratios (w =
                  v<SUB>w</SUB>/v<SUB>o</SUB> ≤ 1), such as symbiotic
                  systems. We revisit the implementation of the BHL
                  model and introduce a geometric correction factor
                  that accounts for the varying orientation of the
                  accretion cylinder relative to the wind direction.
                  This correction ensures physically plausible
                  accretion efficiencies (η ≤ 1) for all w in circular
                  orbits. Our new implementation naturally predicts
                  the flattening of the accretion efficiency observed
                  in numerical simulations for w &lt; 1, without the
                  need for ad hoc adjustments. We also peer into the
                  implications of our prescription for the
                  less-explored case of eccentric orbits, highlighting
                  the key role of the geometric correction factor in
                  shaping the accretion process. We compare our
                  predictions with numerical simulations, finding good
                  agreement for a wide range of parameters.
                  Applications to the symbiotic star R Aqr and the
                  X-ray binary LS 5039 are presented. This improved
                  implementation offers a more accurate description of
                  wind accretion in binary systems, with implications
                  for stellar evolution, population synthesis, and
                  observational data interpretation.},
